  <!-- About Section -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>"The Maze" is a portfolio project that I developed to demonstrate my skills in raycasting, game mechanics, and real-time rendering. The inspiration came from my interest in creating an immersive 3D environment that could be navigated in real-time.</p>
    
    <h3>Goals Achieved:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Raycasting and Rendering:</strong> Successfully implemented, allowing accurate 3D environment rendering.</li>
      <li><strong>Orientation and Rotation:</strong> Real-time camera controls are functioning smoothly, enhancing player navigation.</li>
      <li><strong>Wall Rendering:</strong> Improved wall rendering differentiates between NORTH/SOUTH and EAST/WEST walls.</li>
      <li><strong>Collision Detection:</strong> Accurate collision detection prevents the player from passing through walls.</li>
      <li><strong>Map Parsing:</strong> The map parser loads maze layouts from external files for easy modifications.</li>
      <li><strong>2D Minimap:</strong> A toggleable 2D minimap assists with navigation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Remaining Challenges:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Enemy Integration:</strong> Developing enemy behaviors and interactions with the player remains a challenge.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Adaptations and Next Steps:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Focus on Enemy Integration:</strong> Defining enemy behavior and AI.</li>
      <li><strong>Ongoing Enhancements:</strong> Refine features like texture integration and gameplay balance.</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation and Maintenance:</strong> Keep updating the project documentation and ensure code quality.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Progress Rating:</strong> 7/10</p>
    <p>Based on completed milestones and implemented features, I rate my progress at 7 out of 10.</p>
